To install:
    npm install

To run:
    First, install

    Next:
        npm run start
    
    This opens a command-line

    Type the name of a function to execute that function
        For example you could type: "echo" followed by some text

    Every time you execute a function, git_acp is called
        git_acp will git add, git commit then git push (automate git to save time)

    You don't have to type out the full name
        For example, to run "file_js_new", you could write "fjw" instead. It will look for functions containing an 'f' followed by 'j' followed by 'w'. [f]ile_[j]s_ne[w] satisfies this.
