To install:
    npm install

To run:
    First, install

    Next:
        npm run start
    
    This opens a "command-line"

    Type the name of a function to execute that function
        For example you could type: "noop" followed by some text

    Every time you execute a function, git_acp is called
        git_acp will git add, git commit then git push (automate git to save time)

    You don't have to type out the full name
        For example, to run "file_js_new", you could write "fjew" instead. It will look for functions containing an 'f' followed by 'j' followed by 'e' etc. [f]ile_[j]s_n[e][w] satisfies this.

    To create a new javascript file, type: file_js_new file_name
